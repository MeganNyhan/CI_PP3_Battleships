## Design:

### Design Choices
<p> The company itself is a company with a wide target audience, and with this in mind I wanted to create a site that was accessible to everyone regardless of their technical ability, and ability to operate a computer. I wanted all designs to be simplistic, the navigation to be logical and seamless and for the accessibility to be a primary concern. </p>

### Colour

  <p>The color scheme that I have used throughout the website is taken directly from the brand guidelines that were available to be as a member of the organisation. To verfiy the contrast in colours were accessible I tested them on WebAIM which they all passed as readable. </p>

<details><summary>Colours and Brand Guidelines</summary>
  <img src="assets/images/mdrc-brand-guidelines.png"></details>

 ### Fonts
  <p>Fonts used on the website were Open Sans Bold and Open Sans Light. Open sans bold was used for headings and open sans light was used in paragraphs.</p>

 ### Structure
<p>The strucutre of this website was designed to be easily navagated through and easy to learn. I made sure that each page followed a similar structure but didn't comprimise the content that each page held. The following pages are within the structure of the site:</p>

<ul>
<li> A home Page = Basic information about the site, with an image of the building and a meet the team section.</li>
<li> A Services page = The services page offers an overview of the services offered by the resource center. </li>
<li> A gallery page = Offers the user a chance to see possible familiar faces taking part in local activites/ meetings.    This page aims to encourage the user to want to partake in the activites/ events themselves.</li>
<li> A Contact Page = Gives the user contact information and a google maps view of where the building is. There is also a contact form for a user to use to contact the comapny.</li>

<hr>

### Wireframes

<p>The wireframes included have evolved and changed since I originally drew them up over a week ago. This is due to the limitations of my skills thus far developed and changes I have made personally to the look of the site when building it.</p>

### Source Code Used in Site

<p> Due to limitations in my knowledge I googled certain code that I wanted to use for the site, see code listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li> The meet the team code (both HTML and CSS) was not taken directly but inspired by the following site: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/ howto_css_images_side_by_side.asp </li>

<li> The map code was taken from the following code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5756440/aligning-google-map-with-text </li>

<li> Code to help with the contact form was taken from bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/forms/form-control/ </li>

<li>I also referenced the Love-Running project to help with the grid for the Gallery Section, the social links from the footer and the contact form. It was not copied and pasted directly but it was used for help so I thought I would mention it.</li></ul>
